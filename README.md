# Picarto.TV-Chat-Logger-Scraper

## Motivation

## Installation and usage
Copy the file into a TamperMonkey script, then change the "@match" line to have whatever channel URL you would like to log

## Roadmap
- Store messages as array of stringified objects instead of stringifying the entire array.  Would allow quicker more efficient reading and eliminate unecessary parsing/stringifying
- Store message ID seperately for only the last stored message to save space since only the last message ID is every used
- Add a way to download chat txt file without manually changing code, probably by typing a certain message in chat box
- Some additional parsing needed
