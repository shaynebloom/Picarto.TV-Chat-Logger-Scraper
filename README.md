# Picarto.TV-Chat-Logger-Scraper

## Motivation

## Installation and usage
Copy the file into a TamperMonkey script, then change the "@match" line to have whatever channel URL you would like to log

## Roadmap
-Store messages as array of stringified objects instead of stringifying the entire array.  Would allow quicker more efficient reading and eliminate unecessary parsing/stringifying
-Store message ID seperately for only the last stored message to save space since only the last message ID is every used
